# Gamifications
A repo of all collaborative projects about gamifications

#### Links
Project management board: https://bucknell-global.monday.com/boards/335985168

#### Directory structure
- Each subfolder of the **/Gamficiations** folder will represent a project.

- The details of each project will be included in the README.md of each project.

#### Collaboration method
###### General idea
Each task has one **Owner** (the person who performs the task) and one or more **Reviewer** (the person who reviews the task before mark it as completion).

When the owner finishes a task, they update the status of the task to 'Waiting for Review", and inform the reviewer. 
The reviewer is responsible for reviewing the result, providing feedback and marking the task as completed.

###### How it works
On the project management [board](https://bucknell-global.monday.com/boards/335985168),
each task will have three fields: 
- **Owner**  - the person who performs the task
- **Status** - the status of the task. 
The Owner is responsible for changing the status of the task to indicate the task's progress. Can change to anything except for 'Done'. 
If change to 'Waiting for Review', then the system will inform the Reviewer(s) to review the task.
