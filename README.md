## Directory structure
- Each subfolder of the **/Gamficiations** folder will represent a project.

- The details of each project will be included in the README.md of each project.

- All importants text documents related to a project should be included in the repo of that project, preferably markdown files so that
the files can be easily accessed and found.  
- Larger files can be stored in the google drive folder
- Files stored elsewhere should have a link pointing to that file saved to a markdown file in the project folder.

## Collaboration method
### General idea
Each task has one **Owner** (the person who performs the task) and one or more **Reviewer** (the person who reviews the task before mark it as completion).

When the owner finishes a task, they update the status of the task to 'Waiting for Review", and inform the reviewer(s). 
The reviewer(s) is responsible for reviewing the result, providing feedback and marking the task as completed.

#### Structure
On the project management [board](https://bucknell-global.monday.com/boards/335985168),
each task will have three fields: 
- **Owner**  - the person who performs the task.
- **Status** - the status of the task. 
- **Reviewers** - people who will review the task.

#### Rules
- Any person can set up a task and choose the *Reviewer(s)* and *Owner* . 
- Only the *Owner* can choose the deadline. The *Owner* can also change the *Reviwer(s)*.
- Each task should be small, ideally completable within a day's time. This depends on how much time the *Owner* can invest in each day.

#### Process
- When the *Owner* starts working on a project, changes the status of that project to *Working on it*.

- If the *Owner* is stuck and requires more time to complete the task, change the status to *Stucked*. The system will automatically extends the deadline

- If the *Owner* believes they has completed the task, change the status to *Waiting for Review*. 

- If change to *Waiting for Review*, then the system will inform the Reviewer(s) to review the task.
